If negative numbers are allowed in the given array, it significantly changes the problem. In the original problem statement, we were working with a set of distinct positive integers and finding combinations to reach a positive target. When negative numbers are introduced, there are a few important considerations and potential changes to the problem:

1. **Infinite Solutions:** With negative numbers, there may be an infinite number of solutions because you can keep subtracting negative values from the target to reach any number. This means that for some input cases, there might not be a finite number of valid combinations, which could lead to a different approach or a more complex problem definition.

2. **No Bounds on Combinations:** The original problem assumes that the answer can fit in a 32-bit integer, which implies a limitation on the number of valid combinations. When negative numbers are allowed, this constraint might no longer hold true because you can have an infinite number of valid combinations.

3. **Difficulty in Problem Solving:** Introducing negative numbers can make the problem significantly more complex and potentially unsolvable in certain cases, especially if there are no bounds on the number of combinations or if the problem doesn't specify a particular range for the target.

To make the problem well-defined when negative numbers are allowed, you might consider adding additional constraints or specifying the problem more precisely. For example:

- **Limit on Combinations:** You could add a constraint that limits the number of valid combinations to a certain maximum value (similar to the original problem statement). This would make the problem solvable and bounded.

- **Range for the Target:** You could specify a range for the target value, so it's not an open-ended problem. For example, you might ask for the number of combinations that add up to a target value between -100 and 100.

- **Specific Problem Context:** You could provide more context to the problem, such as asking for combinations within a certain real-world scenario where negative numbers make sense and have a meaningful interpretation.
