Let's step through the code using the given input `nums = [1, 3, 4, 2, 2]` and debug it in a step-by-step manner:

Step 1: Initialize `n` as the size of the `nums` array, which is 5, and set `i` to 0.

Step 2: Enter the loop since `i < n`.

Loop 1:
    i = 0, nums[i] = 1

    Since `nums[i]` is equal to `i + 1`, increment `i` by 1.
    i = 1

Loop 2:
    i = 1, nums[i] = 3

    `nums[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`. So, we enter the inner condition.

    Calculate the `correct` index value: `correct = nums[i] - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2`.

    Check if `nums[i]` is equal to `nums[correct]`:
    nums[i] = 3, nums[correct] = nums[2] = 4

    Since `nums[i]` is not equal to `nums[correct]`, swap `nums[i]` and `nums[correct]`:
    Now, the `nums` array becomes: [1, 4, 3, 2, 2]

    Do not increment `i`, as we want to recheck the current element in the next iteration.

Loop 3:
    i = 1, nums[i] = 4

    `nums[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`. So, we enter the inner condition.

    Calculate the `correct` index value: `correct = nums[i] - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3`.

    Check if `nums[i]` is equal to `nums[correct]`:
    nums[i] = 4, nums[correct] = nums[3] = 2

    Since `nums[i]` is not equal to `nums[correct]`, swap `nums[i]` and `nums[correct]`:
    Now, the `nums` array becomes: [1, 2, 3, 4, 2]

    Do not increment `i`, as we want to recheck the current element in the next iteration.

Loop 4:
    i = 1, nums[i] = 2

    `nums[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`. So, we enter the inner condition.

    Calculate the `correct` index value: `correct = nums[i] - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`.

    Check if `nums[i]` is equal to `nums[correct]`:
    nums[i] = 2, nums[correct] = nums[1] = 2

    Since `nums[i]` is equal to `nums[correct]`, we found a duplicate, and the duplicate number is 2.

Step 3: Return the found duplicate number, which is 2.

The code successfully finds the duplicate number in the `nums` array.
